# Volume Between Vertical Lines

Volume Between Vertical Lines is a custom indicator for MT4, MT5, and cTrader coded by EarnForex.com. It calculates the sum of volume across all bars between two vertical lines that you can move freely on the chart.

It can be used to compare total volume during different periods and assess trend strength.

While MT4 and cTrader can only do tick volume, the MT5 version of this Volume Between Vertical Lines indicator can also work with real volume for supporting symbols.
